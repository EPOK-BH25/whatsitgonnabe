## Motivation

In today's fast-paced world, small and independent businesses often lack visibility and discoverability despite offering valuable services. MINTY EXTERIOR was built to bridge that gap ‚Äî empowering both vendors and users with a simple yet powerful platform that facilitates service discovery, trust, and engagement.

We wanted to:

- Make service browsing intuitive through map-based visualization
- Enable secure and seamless user access without the friction of complex logins
- Support authentic local businesses by letting them showcase their offerings
- Let users quickly filter and find what they need using relevant tags

By combining modern web technologies with thoughtful design, we aim to create a tool that connects people with services they can trust ‚Äî all in just a few taps.
